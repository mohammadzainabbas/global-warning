The data resolves the main IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 2006 categories. Subsector data for Energy, Industrial Processes, Agriculture and Waste is available for CO2, CH4, and N2O.

For example, emissions data for Russia are not available prior to 1990. To generate a more complete and useful time series we have estimated emissions for Russia prior to 1990 first by using data from BP back to 1985, then by assuming that the share of Russia’s emissions in the USSR was constant up until 1985. Countries whose data are affected by this estimation method are listed on ""Methods"" section of http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions , and their data in earlier periods must be considered to have significantly higher uncertainty.",Climate Watch displays only territorial CO2 emissions.
